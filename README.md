# MVC2

This project was made for several different assignments in the course I'm studying. 
It's a website where you can create objects that represent people, store them in a database and show them as a list. 
It's also possible to delete entries or enter a string to search the list to show all the people who has that string in their name or the name of their city.

It's made with ASP.NET MVC. One page uses AJAX to have a single page application. The people are put in SQL databases by using Entity Framework.
It will soon have tables for cities and countries where people can be assigned to a city and cities to a country. It will also soon use ASP.NET's Identity and a part using React.
